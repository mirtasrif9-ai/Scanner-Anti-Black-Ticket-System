# Scanner-Anti Black Ticket System
QR code scanner that can validate tickets dynamically.
At the station, passengers present their QR code for scanning at the entry gate. The system 
validates the QR code in real-time, checking its authenticity and validity against the 
database. If successful, the passenger is granted entry. In cases of invalid or mismatched 
QR codes, access is denied, and appropriate feedback is displayed.
